# Agency Creative

Landing page for a creative agency.

To implement color schemes and a color scheme switcher, I rely on these articles and video:

- [Sass vars, CSS vars, and semantic theme vars](https://daverupert.com/2020/10/variable-layers/) by Dave Rupert,
- [prefers-color-scheme: Hello darkness, my old friend](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/) by Thomas Steiner,
- [–ü–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª—é—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å üåì —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–π —Å—Ö–µ–º—ã: —Ä–∞–¥–∏–æ–∫–Ω–æ–ø–∫–∏, CSS-—Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä—ã –∏ –∏–Ω–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—è, SVG-–∏–∫–æ–Ω–∫–∏, JS –∏ localStorage](https://youtu.be/8LFbS78a4Rw) by Vadim Makeev (but I don't use CSS filters here).
